Levi makes it to the peninsula of Paradis. It is said that this place is full of Titans who have the strength of a thousand soildiers. It is up to Levi to cross these lands, as it is the only way to get back to TooToo. It is not the first time Levi has set foot in these lands before, as he did so when he first began his previous journey but he knew that the titans were none if he were to pass the summit of Paradis.
