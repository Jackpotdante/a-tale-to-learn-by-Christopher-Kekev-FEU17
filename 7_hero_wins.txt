Levi is lying on the floor without any powers left. As King Dragon and the titans prepare the final blow against Levi, a bright light shines upon the sky. The ray of light directs itself to Levi's Zantetsu and it changes into a radiant blade, one reminiscent of the one that Eren had oh so long ago. Levi slashes the air and Zantetsu emits a beam that has the force to take out King Dragon and the titans. 
King Dragon couldn't withstand the attack and King Dragon reaches his demise.
